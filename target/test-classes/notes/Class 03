Hooks vs Background

Hooks are implemented for all the features across your project and
they are based on annotations @Before and @After

Background is implemented for the specific feature. It is used to define a step or
series of steps which are common to all the tests inside your feature file.

Data Driven Test in Cucumber ca be performed in 2 ways:
Scenario Outline with Examples
Datatable

Scenario wvs Scenario Outline:
Scenario will run the steps only once and finish the execution

Scenario outline will run all the steps same number of times depending on how many
sets of data you have stored inside examples. Examples

HW:
Search for employee
5 sets of data for searching by id
5 sets of data searching by name

Use background, and scenario outline
