Maven is a build automation tool which helps us to manage our dependencies and plugins and let's us to run our
tests properly. the heart of Maven is pom.xml file

Maven has 2 basic(built-in) cycles:
. default-handels your project's deployment
2. clean - handle your project's cleaning
3. site - handles any project's site documentation

iframes are void returns, we do not get anything in return.
